![Framework scheme](pics/framework_scheme.png)

ARTEMIS is a universal information-theoretic approach to  study communication in molecular systems and implemented as Python/C++ program package. The method is based on the analysis of the mutual information matrix obtained for all pairs of residues/molecules within a system from MD data  using the PARENT software package ([GitHub](https://github.com/markusfleck/PARENT), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01217)).
